*notmuch Dashboard*

notmuch dashboard provides a new =nm= org link type that allows you to execute
various notmuch queries when clicked. Such links can be organised into a
dashboard by simply writing an org file as shown below:

** Installation

Evaluate the buffer and you're good to go. It is your responsibility to
write an org file with links pointing to various queries on your mailboxes.

** Configuration

*** Links

The link syntax is quite intuitive:

#+begin_src org
[[nm:query|format|count][description]]
#+end_src

=query= must be a valid notmuch query and =count= (optional) is the maximum
number of threads to be returned. When the link is clicked,
=notmuch-search= is called with the proper query.

#+begin_src org
[[nm:tag:unread][All unread]]
[[nm:tag:unread||10][Last 10 unread]]
#+end_src

=format= can be used to specify that =query= results are to be counted in
order to update the description using the given format:

#+begin_src org
[[nm:tag:unread|%3d][---]]
#+end_src

With the example above, when the link is cliked, the =---= part will be
replaced by the number of unread mails using the =notmuch count= command.

*** Using saved searches

Queries can include references to =notmuch-saved-searches=. A saved search is
denoted with ~bm:<bookmarkName>~

~bookmarkName~ cannot contain spaces nor ]. A query can contain several
bookmarks, but their expansion is not recursive.

For example, assuming the following saved search exists:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp   :exports both
(add-to-list 'notmuch-saved-searches
             '(:name "Unread"
               :query "tag:unread and not tag:trash")
             t)
#+end_src

the dashboard query:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp   :exports both
nm:bm:Unread and date:7d..now
#+end_src

will be expanded to:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp   :exports both
nm:(tag:unread and not tag:trash) and date:7d..now
#+end_src

Note that parenthesis are added around the saved search to make sure the
expansion is hygienic.

*** Key bindings

Keybindings can be configured using the =KEYMAP= keyword in your org file:

#+begin_src org
#+KEYMAP: key | elisp function
#+end_src

For example, if you want to bind =;= to jump to a saved search, you could
write:

#+begin_src org
#+KEYMAP: ; | notmuch-jump-search
#+end_src

*** Query test

In the provided [[dashboard.org]], there's a definition for a notmuch query that can
be called directly inside the org file using [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]]. This can be convenient if
you want to test a query before creating a link. Usage is quite simple:

#+begin_src org
#+CALL: query(tag:unread, 10)
#+RESULTS:
#+end_src

Just type *C-c C-c* on the call line and you should see query results under the
RESULTS line.

** Usage

To activate the dashboard, type =notmuch-dashboard-mode=. This will turn on
=notmuch-dashboard-mode= minor mode and install any custom keybindings in
the current buffer.

To edit the org file, you'll need to turn off =notmuch-dashboard-mode=.
